Written in React.


This project includes:

📟LocalStorage Data Storage:

    The app uses localStorage to store daily improvements, ensuring that data is persisted even after the user closes or     refreshes the page.

🪄Adding New Improvements:

      Users can add new daily improvements through a form. The submitted improvements are appended to the list of existing entries.

📖Displaying Daily Improvements: 

      The app displays a list of daily improvements, showing the improvement's title, a checkbox to mark it as completed, and a "Delete" button to remove it.

📌Completing Improvements: 

      Users can mark improvements as completed by checking the associated checkboxes. The app updates the completion status accordingly.

✂️Deleting Improvements: 

      Users can delete individual improvements by clicking the "Delete" button. This action removes the selected improvement from the list.

🗒️Introduction Message: 

      An introductory message explains the purpose of the app, encouraging users to log daily improvements. It also introduces the concept of ordering a book with 100 entries.

📘Book Order Notification: 

      When the list of improvements reaches 15 items, the app displays a mini-form for users to enter their email. This email submission appears to be related to the concept of ordering a book with their daily improvements.

✉️Email Submission Handling: 

      Upon submitting an email in the mini-form, the app logs the email and provides feedback to the user, changing the button text to "Sent!" and adding a brief animation.

⏱️Animation Reset: 

      After 2 seconds, the animation is reset to its original state.

🖼️Styling: 

      The app applies CSS styles to elements for an improved user interface.

📈Error Handling:

        While not explicitly mentioned, the app should have error handling mechanisms, especially for cases like empty submissions or failed local storage.
